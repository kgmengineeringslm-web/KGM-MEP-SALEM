        <h2>Our Heritage: A Legacy of Excellence Since 1987 </h2>
        <p>
            The journey of <strong>KGM MEP Engineering Services</strong> began in <strong>1987</strong>, founded by the visionary <strong>Late Mr. Murugesan Gopal</strong>. 
            What started as a dedicated electrical and plumbing service provider soon grew into a household name across <strong>Salem and Yercaud</strong>.

           Under his leadership, the company specialized in complex <strong>Electrical Motor Repairs</strong> and <strong>Borewell Motor Installations</strong>, becoming a trusted partner for residential and industrial clients alike.
